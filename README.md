# NAND-to-TETRIS---Part-1-and-2
From Nand to Tetris Building a Modern Computer From First Principles.

This project involves building a simple computer from the ground-up. 

In PART 1, 

We begin with building the logic gates from the given NAND gate and work our way up to build the ALU, CPU, Memory etc.;
finally we build an Assembler to convert our assembly language code (.asm file) to binary machine code (.hack file).

In PART 2,

We build a VM Translator to translate the virtual machine code (.vm files) to assembly language code(.asm files).
Then we build the Jack Compiler to compile the high level, Jack code to virtual machine code.
Finally, we build the Operating System to provide an interface to perform the various tasks.
